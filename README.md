# NationalParks

## Motivation
Since visiting my first ever National Park, I have been fascinated by their diversity and the unique view the offer about the natural landscapes and biodiversity of the U.S. I have since visited 5 of them and I do not plan on stopping anytime soon. Through
this project, I wanted to combine my passion of photography and machine learning to fuel my curiosity about the parks.

## Goal
Since President Ulysses S. Grant established Yellowstone as the first National Park in 1872, 61 other locations have joined the program. The National Parks are the best illustration of what the American ecosystem has to offer. Every year, the National
Parks welcome more than 80 millions visitors. The goal of usparks.io is to transport visitors into the best locations of each park. By using machine learning and clustering techniques, the application identify the most photographed location and gives the possibility to access some of these photographs. This application can be used as a tool to help you plan your upcoming trip to a National Park or simply to give you a virtual access to the most secluded ones.

## Data
The National Parks information was retrieved from the [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_national_parks_of_the_United_States?oldformat=true) page In order to make this project feasible, we needed access to a large dataset of geolocalized photographs. The website data was scrapped using the popular python library [BeautifulSoup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/). Once the initial information has been gathered for all 62 National Parks, the park boundaries were obtained from the official National Park Service [Website](https://www.nps.gov/planyourvisit/maps.htm). The obtained Geojson files are used to identify pictures that are taken inside each park.
The photographs were obtained using the [Flickr API](https://www.flickr.com/services/api/). For each park, we create a bounding box using the maximum and minimum longitude and latitude obtained from the Geojson files.

## Clustering
In order to identify the most visited locations, we used Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN). The longitude and latitude of each photograph are used to cluster the photos. The DBSCAN algorithm takes two parameters. The first one in the maximum distance used to search neighbors and the second one is the minimum number of neighbors to be contained within the maximum distance to be considered a cluster.

## Tags
When a photo is uploaded by a user on Flickr, tags can be added manually to the post. Tags consist of words that are relevant to the photo (location, photo content). The tags are compiled for each cluster and sorted using the Term Frequencyâ€“Inverse Document
Frequency (tf-idf). This summary of the most import tags is then provided on the cluster page to help describe the location corresponding to the cluster.
